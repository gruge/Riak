# Riak overview

a simple run-through of Riak features and usage

## What Does Riak Mean?
Riak is an open-source, Web scalable distributed database based on the NoSQL and Dynamo database system. It is developed by [Basho Technologies](https://riak.com/).

Riak is highly distributed database software that provides scalable, reliable performance in variety of different operation environments. 

## Benefits of NoSQL
#### NoSQL databases offer enterprises important advantages over traditional RDBMS, including:

**Scalability**: NoSQL databases use a horizontal scale-out methodology that makes it easy to add or reduce capacity quickly and non-disruptively with commodity hardware. 

**Performance**: By simply adding commodity resources, enterprises can increase performance with NoSQL databases. This enables organizations to continue to deliver reliably fast user experiences with a predictable return on investment for adding resources—again, without the overhead associated with manual sharding.

**High Availability**: NoSQL databases are generally designed to ensure high availability and avoid the complexity that comes with a typical RDBMS architecture that relies on primary and secondary nodes. Some “distributed” NoSQL databases use a masterless architecture that automatically distributes data equally among multiple resources so that the application remains available for both read and write operations even when one node fails.
