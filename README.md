# Riak overview

a simple run-through of Riak features and usage

### What Does Riak Mean?
Riak is an open-source, Web scalable distributed database based on the NoSQL and Dynamo database system. It is developed by [Basho Technologies](https://riak.com/).

Riak is highly distributed database software that provides scalable, reliable performance in variety of different operation environments. 

## BENEFITS OF NOSQL
### NoSQL databases offer enterprises important advantages over traditional RDBMS, including:

Scalability: NoSQL databases use a horizontal scale-out methodology that makes it easy to add or reduce capacity quickly and non-disruptively with commodity hardware. This eliminates the tremendous cost and complexity of manual sharding that is necessary when attempting to scale RDBMS.
Performance: By simply adding commodity resources, enterprises can increase performance with NoSQL databases. This enables organizations to continue to deliver reliably fast user experiences with a predictable return on investment for adding resources—again, without the overhead associated with manual sharding.
High Availability: NoSQL databases are generally designed to ensure high availability and avoid the complexity that comes with a typical RDBMS architecture that relies on primary and secondary nodes. Some “distributed” NoSQL databases use a masterless architecture that automatically distributes data equally among multiple resources so that the application remains available for both read and write operations even when one node fails.
Global Availability: By automatically replicating data across multiple servers, data centers, or cloud resources, distributed NoSQL databases can minimize latency and ensure a consistent application experience wherever users are located. An added benefit is a significantly reduced database management burden from manual RDBMS configuration, freeing operations teams to focus on other business priorities.
Flexible Data Modeling: NoSQL offers the ability to implement flexible and fluid data models. Application developers can leverage the data types and query options that are the most natural fit to the specific application use case rather than those that fit the database schema. The result is a simpler interaction between the application and the database and faster, more agile development.
